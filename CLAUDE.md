# CLAUDE.md — chaundacdallas.com project brief

This file briefs any AI agent working in this repo. Read it before making changes.

## Who this is for
Chaunda C. Dallas, MSIT — Healthcare Cybersecurity Strategist and Digital First Responder.
The NAME leads everywhere. "Digital First Responder (DFR)" is a facet of her identity, not the headline.
Chaunda C. Dallas LLC is infrastructure — it appears ONLY in footers and the Federal Credentials section, never in public-facing hero copy or positioning.

## Non-negotiable brand guardrails
Flag any violation BEFORE building; do not silently "fix" copy in ways that break these.

- Core tagline: "I didn't leave healthcare. I learned to defend it."
- NEVER frame her as "transitioning," "pivoting," "crossing over," or "leaving" healthcare. She never left.
- CNA is a certification, never a job title. Correct title progression: ER Tech -> Lead ER Tech -> Epic Super User -> Clinical Coordinator. Never write "CNA ->" or "CNA & Registration Clerk" as a role.
- Canonical Piedmont display title: "Epic Super User, Clinical Preceptor & Lead ER Tech". Use this exact string wherever the Piedmont role is titled (site timeline, About copy, resume).
- Never reference "Former RN."
- CompTIA Security+ is NOT earned — do not list it as a completed cert. Current cert target is Microsoft SC-900.
- Every public section should touch >=2 of: Healthcare, Patient Safety, Connected Devices, Human Consequence.
- Voice: ER grit, semi-professional, laid-back, direct. No fluff. See BRAND_VOICE.md for approved language variations — rotate them; never repeat the same origin phrasing or the "28 years" line twice on one page.

## Lane hierarchy (do not invert)
1. Healthcare Cybersecurity SME — IoMT, medical device security, GRC, clinical AI risk. (Primary. Pays now.)
2. AI Red Team for Healthcare — growth lane.
3. Sports Technology & Wearable Security — SOFT / secondary mention only. Same methodology (athletes' biometrics = patients' data). May appear as a single "Secondary / Future" card, but NEVER as a primary hero button or top-nav item. Brand arc: protecting patients -> connected healthcare -> connected athletes.

Priority through Aug 5, 2026 (Black Hat): income + a remote healthcare-cyber role. Nothing on the site should distract from that.

## Design system (already in use — match exactly)
Colors:
- Green #1E5040 — identity: headers, logo, nav, primary UI
- Amber #E0A83E — CTAs, highlights, hover states
- Crimson #8B1E24 — pulse/ECG spike ONLY, never decorative or general UI
- Cream #F3ECDD — backgrounds, negative space
- Slate #3D4142 — body text, secondary UI

Fonts: Cormorant Garamond (display/name), DM Sans (body), DM Mono (labels/mono).

Shared components: the universal .ccd-nav bar and .ccd-footer appear on every page and must stay consistent across all pages. Some pages use the external styles.css; a few carry inline <style> blocks — keep tokens identical either way.

## Site architecture
Main site (GitHub Pages): Home, About, Expertise, Services, DFR Framework, Playbook (Field Notes hub), Documentary, Resources, Contact, Book, WiCyS, /intake.
Lab: lab.chaundacdallas.com (Digital First Responder Lab — IoMT scenarios + Healthcare Ransomware Intelligence Tracker). Always link the lab by this subdomain, never a raw github.io URL.
